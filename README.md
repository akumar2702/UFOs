# UFOs

## Overview
### This challenge was to test our knowledge on JavaScript. We were helping Dana to create a website that uses filters and searches the data that the user wants to find and view. We create multiple folders and create the website using the skills that were taught in the module.

## Results
### There are multiple searches that one can do in the website.

### This shows searching with only the date

### This shows searching only with the city

## Summary

### One drawback is that the website is limited to the data that we received in the module.

### Two changes that I would make are to add more data to the website and to also add more filters according to te duration of the video or article one tries to find. This will allow more users to visit the site and conduct more searches and not be limited.
